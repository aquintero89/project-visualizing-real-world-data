We can how involved is the Spanish society with this beautiful sport when 67% of the population said they were fans or had a liking for a particular club. You just need to stop and see all the emotions, feelings and all kind of good things that can be seen on 90 minutes of this master piece. 

Now let's go to what it concerns to this project. On every level of life, decision needs to be taken based (when it's possible) on relevant data. On this sport, the numbers donâ€™t lie. The statistics are there, individually and as a team: from trophies to completed passes. This numbers can be very useful to improve certain aspects of the game that at the end, could lead you to (the most important thing in every sport) wins the highest quantity of tournaments. 

The individual player statistics are going to impact negative or positive on the overall performance. You can have one player that could carry the whole team or you can have four or five with very good numbers that could lead your squad to success.
